Hi, my name is Yenfry Herrera and I am a self taught software developer. I have been coding since I was 15 years old. My first coding language was C, and later on I learned a couple of languages more, like PHP, Python (I love python), and Java. Then I took care myself of my knowledge about the front-end, so that I learned JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I am also strong with databases; MySQL is my preffered one. I know a litte bit about shell scripting under linux env as well. 

I love to learn, and I think we need to keep updating our knowledge everyday.

In case you need anything from me, you can reach me by using my email address: yenfri01@gmail.com
